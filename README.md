🛒 Retail Inventory Optimization

📍 Sep 2025 – Oct 2025 | Advanced Excel, Inventory Analysis, EOQ, ABC Segmentation

📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on retail inventory optimization for 121 SKUs using Advanced Excel techniques.
The analysis includes ABC segmentation, EOQ, ROP, inventory turnover, and supplier performance, aiming to balance cost efficiency with service level optimization.

Key goals:
- Prioritize high-impact SKUs for procurement and replenishment.
- Optimize order quantities and stock levels to reduce costs.
- Identify demand patterns, stockout risks, and inventory bottlenecks.
- Evaluate supplier performance to improve procurement planning.

🎯 Problem Addressed
- Perform key metrics analysis to understand inventory dynamics
- Evaluate and suggest strategic recommendation to improve inventory efficiency

⚙️ Study Research
- Which product categories contribute the most to the total inventory level?
- What is the optimal order quantity that balances demand, ordering cost, and holding cost?
- When should inventory replenishment occur to prevent stockouts?
- How efficiently does inventory move within the supply chain, which products are overstocked or understocked?
- Which suppliers demonstrate the high performance?

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Excel: Advanced formulas, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting
